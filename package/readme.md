What approach should I use if I want to solve a quiz statistically. Let me explain in more detail. There is a quiz written in unknown language. I can identify a question and answers - they look like hash codes. I can select only one answer per question. There exists 200 questions in the question book. Each question has 4 possible answers - only one answer is correct. The server randomly picks 40 questions and sends them to me. What approach or algorithm should I use to compute correct answer for every question? How long will it take me on average?
