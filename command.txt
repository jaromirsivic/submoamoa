Create a new component called “Polygon”. 


Fix (or completely rewrite) the polygon component.
The user will be able to draw a closed polygon using this component. Whenever a user clicks he adds a new point. If a user is in the adding mode and he clicks on the very first point,
the polygon is closed, there will be no more points added to the polygon from this point. User can only move existing points or delete entire polygon and start drawing new one from scratch.
The component is based on the "Image" component with the same set of props (so it can display image behind the polygon) plus following props:
- borderColor: color – color of the polygon line, default value #009900ff
- fillColor: color – color of the inside of the polygon, default value #00ee0055
- lineWidth: number – width of the line in pixels, default value 1px
- maxPoints: identifies how many points can the polygon have, default value is 32.
- polygons: gets or sets an array of polygons, each polygon is identified by array of points. Entire structure is in json format.

Demonstrate the usage of the component in Sandbox -> ComponentDemo page

Update the behavior of the "Polygon". Whenever a polygon is closed by clicking on the first point or by
exhausting all points available the polygon should not disapear (current behavior). It must stay where it is
and be infilled with the fillColor. The size of the initial point will be the same as the size of all other
points (currently during drawing mode the size of the very first point is bigger than those of other points
that is OK, but after the polygon is closed the size should be set to the size of other point).
Update Sandbox -> ComponentDemo add a button under each polygon. After clicking the button
the alert message will pop up displaying polygons json. That way I will be able to check if the json is OK.

Update Polygon component. Add following props:
reticleX - x position of the reticle (value between 0 and 1)
reticleY - y position of the reticle (value between 0 and 1)
showReticle - boolean, default value is false
reticleSize - default value is 1
reticleAlpha - default value is 50% or rather 0.5 which means that the reticle is half transparent
reticleColor - color of the reticle, default value is red.
Implement reticle which is displayed if showReticle is true and uses theme like in the picture enclosed to this chat.
Add new examples to the ComponentsDemo page showing various capabilities of reticle.

# ColorPicker
Create a new ColorPicker component. The user will be able to select a color from the color picker, or
specify the color using the hex code. The component should have the following props:
- color: string – the selected color
- onChange: function – the function to be called when the color is changed
- showHex: boolean – whether to show the hex code input or not
- showAlpha: boolean – whether to show the alpha input or not
Demonstrate the usage of the component in Sandbox -> ComponentDemo page

Update the Polygon component. 
- Remove "reticleAlpha" prop, the alpha channel will be included in "reticleColor".
- add "mode" props. "mode" can be one of: "viewer", "designer", "joystick".
In a viewer mode the user can only see image, polygons
and reticle (of course polygons and reticle will be visible if there are any
polygons and if the showReticle is true). In th "designer" mode the user can draw
polygons. Joystick mode will be implemented later. Do not bother with joystick mode at the moment.

Update the Polygon component.
Implement the "joystick" mode.
In the "joystick" mode user cannot draw or edit polygons.
In the "joystick" mode the user can click on any part of the component.
As soon as he clicks on the image the initial point called static point is displayed as a circle
with color "joystickColor" (default value is #999999cc) and size "joystickSize".
On top of it is another circle called dynamic point again with color "joystickColor" and size "joystickSize".
The centers of the circle are connected with a dotted line of width "joystickLineWidth" (default value is 2).
There will be a "joystickLineMaxLength" prop which will define the maximum length of the line
and therefore maximum distance between the centers of two circles. The default value of "joystickLineMaxLength"
is 0.25 which means that the maximum distance between the centers of two circles is 25% of the image size
computed from the smaller dimension of the image. If the user clicks on the image, moves the mouse or fingertip
while still pressing left mouse button or fingertip - and the distance between the centers of the two circles
is greater than the maximum length, the dynamic point will be placed at the point on the image that is at the
maximum length from the static point and at the same time closest to the clicked point or fingertip.
If the user releases the left mouse button or fingertip the dynamic point will snap to the clicked point
and disappear. The animation length is defined by "joystickSnapAnimationDuration" prop (default value is 0.1s).
Demonstrate the usage of the component in Sandbox -> ComponentDemo page.

Update the Polygon component.
Add event "onJoystickMove". It will be called when the dynamic point moves.
There are x, y parameters of the event object.
The x, y parameters are the coordinates of the dynamic point relative to the static point.
Min value is -1, max value is 1.
Add "joystickLineColor1" prop. It defines the color of the line when the dynamic
point is on top of the static point. Default value is #5555ffff.
Add "joystickLineColor2" prop. It defines the color of the line when the dynamic
point is as far as possible from the static point. Default value is #ff0000ff.

Demonstrate the usage of the component in Sandbox -> ComponentDemo page.
Display x, y coordinates of the dynamic point relative to the static point in the label.


Update the Polygon component.
Add "joystickZeroRadius" prop. It defines the radius of the circle when the
dynamic point is almost on top of the static point. In this case the onJoystickMove event is still
called but the x, y parameters are 0.
Default value is 0.03.

There is a problem with the Slider component on a mobile devices.
I have tried to use the Slider component from the chrome web browser on the mobile phone and it does
not allow me to move slider. I can only click on it. Apparently when i press and hold finger in the browser
(above the slider), the browser thinks I want to scroll the
page and it blocks my attempts to move the slider. Fix the issue.

The same applies in the joystick mode.
Fix the issue.

There is still one issue with Polygon component on a mobile devices.
When I am in "joystick" mode and I click and hold the finger on the image
and I do not move it the browser shows me a popup asking me if I want to
download the image. This should not happen. Fix the issue.

There is a problem with the Scene3D component on a mobile devices.
I have tried to use the Scene3D component from the chrome web browser on the mobile phone and it does
not allow me to move the camera. Apparently when I press and hold finger in the browser
(above the Scene3D), the browser thinks I want to scroll the
page and it blocks my attempts to move, rotate or zoom the camera.
Fix the issue.
